# Target List — NT Wagering Licence Holders

Source: NT Dept of Tourism & Hospitality (updated 23 Jan 2026)

## Tier 1 — Best Targets (smaller, hungry, likely to bite)

### 1. BetRight (IRPSX Pty Ltd)
- **CEO:** Anthony Waller (also Chairman, founded BetTube Corp / parent company)
- **Background:** Former founding employee of Sportingbet Australia. 40+ years in wagering. Crypto early adopter. This guy gets it.
- **Contact:** support@betright.com.au (general) | LinkedIn: search "Anthony Waller BetTube"
- **Why target:** Small, independent, Waller is a dealmaker. Listed on NSX so has some corporate governance but still nimble. Already has "franchise" model which means they think about white-labelling.
- **Already offers novelty/politics:** Yes, limited selection

### 2. Dabble (Dabble Sports Pty Ltd)
- **CEO:** Tom Rundle
- **Contact:** hello@dabble.co | Email format: first.last@dabble.com.au
- **LinkedIn:** Tom Rundle — CEO at Dabble (Melbourne)
- **Why target:** Newer entrant, social betting angle, tech-forward brand. Would fit prediction markets well.
- **Funded:** Yes, VC-backed (check PitchBook)

### 3. Palmerbet
- **CEO:** Grant Palmer
- **Founders:** Andrew, Grant, Matthew & Adrian Palmer (four brothers)
- **Contact:** contact@palmerbet.com.au | 1300 12 357
- **HQ:** 98 King St, Canterbury NSW 2193
- **LinkedIn:** Palmerbet company page, search individual Palmers
- **Why target:** Family-owned, 3rd gen bookmaking family, already offers politics & novelty betting. Would love a new edge against the big players.

### 4. CrossBet (Cross Bet Pty Ltd) → NOW ACQUIRED BY NEXTBET
- **Founder:** Scott Cross (est. 2020)
- **Note:** NextBet acquired CrossBet in Sept 2025. Scott Cross still leads. NextBet has "ambitious M&A plans" — might be interested in new verticals.
- **Contact:** Through crossbet.com.au
- **Why target:** New ownership with growth appetite. Small enough to move fast.

### 5. Picklebet / Puntaa
- **CEO:** Nicholas Heaney
- **Co-founders:** Damon Oudejans (COO), Jordan Oudejans (CCO)
- **HQ:** Brisbane + Darwin registered office
- **Contact:** Through picklebet.com | Nick is on LinkedIn (Brisbane)
- **Why target:** Started in esports betting, tech-native team, younger demo. Prediction markets fit their brand perfectly.

### 6. Zinger Bookmaking (NEXT2GO / PuntX)
- **CEO:** Allan Hilzinger
- **Background:** Former CEO of NSW GBOTA, former manager of Chasebet
- **Founded:** 2025 (very new)
- **Contact:** Through next2go or puntx websites
- **Why target:** Brand new operator, actively growing, just launched two brands. Would be hungry for differentiation.

## Tier 2 — Worth Approaching

### 7. PlayUp Interactive
- **CEO/Founder:** Daniel Simic
- **Email:** daniel.simic@playup.com (from public directories)
- **LinkedIn:** Daniel Simic — Founder & CEO PlayUp (Sydney)
- **Why target:** Has been acquisitive, well-funded, but larger and potentially slower. Still worth the email.

### 8. EpicOdds (Vuka Global Pty Ltd)
- **Founder:** Andrew Moshal (cousin of billionaire Martin Moshal)
- **Status:** Relatively new entrant, launched ~2024-2025
- **Contact:** Through epicodds website
- **Why target:** New, well-connected, family has deep pockets. But might be too early-stage themselves to partner.

### 9. Booki Group (Booki.com.au Pty Ltd)
- **Brands:** PonyBet, BetIt Online, Knucklebet, Earlycrow
- **Contact:** Through individual brand sites
- **Why target:** Runs multiple white-label brands — clearly open to new product lines.

## Tier 3 — Long Shots

### 10. BlueBet/Betr (merged)
- **Chairman:** Matthew Tripp
- **CEO:** Andrew Menz
- **Note:** Also acquired TopSport in April 2025. Now a bigger operation. More corporate process but Matthew Tripp is a known innovator.

### 11. Betfair
- **Parent:** Flutter Entertainment (massive global co)
- **Why mention:** Already an exchange model. Natural fit but huge corporate bureaucracy.

## DO NOT APPROACH
- Sportsbet, Ladbrokes/Neds, Bet365, Unibet, PointsBet — too big, too corporate, too slow. Your email dies in a spam filter.

## Polymarket / Market Data (for emails)

**USE THESE NUMBERS — VERIFIED FEB 2026:**
- Polymarket + Kalshi combined: ~$40B trading volume in 2025
- Polymarket alone: ~$13-21B in 2025 (note: volume double-counting issue documented by Paradigm — real volume likely ~$13B after correction)
- Kalshi: $4.39B monthly record (Oct 2025), 2M users, $50B annualised projected
- Kalshi sports: 75% of volume now, $2B sports volume H1 2025
- **Safe number to use in emails:** "prediction markets globally did $40B+ in volume in 2025"
- **US election specifically:** Polymarket did $3.7B+ on the 2024 US presidential election alone
- Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) invested $2B in Polymarket
- Australia: zero regulated equivalents

**IMPORTANT:** Paradigm published a paper (Dec 2025) showing Polymarket volume is commonly double-counted. Use the $40B combined figure (Poly + Kalshi) which is the widely reported number, but be aware if someone pushes back.
