# Cold Email — CEO / Founder

**Subject:** Untapped market, your licence, 50/50 split

Hi [Name],

Prediction markets did $40B+ in trading volume globally in 2025. Polymarket cleared $3.7B on the US presidential election alone. Kalshi hit $4.4B in a single month. ICE (the company behind the NYSE) just put $2B into Polymarket. There's no regulated equivalent in Australia. Zero.

Your NT wagering licence already covers the infrastructure needed to offer event-based markets — RBA rate decisions, federal elections, economic indicators. The regulatory moat is already built. What's missing is the product.

I've built it. Clean exchange UI, AUD-denominated, full KYC/AML, order book, the works. I have an interactive demo ready to show you.

**The deal:** 50/50 revenue split. I build, operate, and grow the product. You provide the regulatory umbrella — your licence, compliance framework, and AUSTRAC registration. Your team doesn't need to build or operate anything. Zero upside risk for you, and a new revenue vertical in a market with no domestic competition.

Quick background — I previously worked at Swyftx where I [ROLE]. I know how to build and scale a regulated trading platform in Australia.

20 minutes is all I need to walk you through the demo. Happy to come to you.
