Hi [Name] — sent you an email about prediction markets in AU. Built a product demo for an AUD exchange (think Polymarket but regulated). Looking for a licence partner. Would love 15 min to show you. — Ben

Hey [Name], not sure if my email landed — just wanted to flag this quickly.

I've built a product demo for an Australian prediction market exchange. Think Polymarket but AUD-denominated, fully regulated, running under an existing NT wagering licence.

The global market is doing billions in volume and Australia has zero competition. I'm looking for one licence partner — 50/50 rev split, I handle all build and ops.

Happy to jump on a quick call or send through the demo link. Cheers, Ben
