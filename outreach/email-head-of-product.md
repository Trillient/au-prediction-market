**Subject:** prediction markets in AU — nobody's doing it

Hi [Name],

Quick one. I've been researching the prediction market space — Polymarket, Kalshi, etc — and the Australian gap is wild. $40B+ in global volume in 2025, ICE just put $2B into Polymarket, zero regulated product in Australia.

I've built a working product demo for an AUD prediction exchange (event markets — RBA decisions, elections, economic data). The UX is ready, the backend architecture is mapped out. What I need is a licence partner.

[Company] already has the NT wagering licence and compliance infra. This would be a new product line your team doesn't have to build — I handle all of it. 50/50 revenue share, clean separation of responsibilities.

Would you be open to a 15-min call this week? I can show you the demo and the market sizing — the numbers are honestly hard to ignore.
