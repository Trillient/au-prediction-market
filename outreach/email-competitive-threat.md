# Cold Email — Competitive Angle (use after initial outreach)

**Subject:** your competitors are looking at this

Hi [Name],

I've been having conversations with a few NT-licensed operators about launching prediction markets in Australia — the first regulated platform for event-based trading (elections, rate decisions, economic outcomes).

Global volume in this space is in the billions. Australia is completely untapped. Whoever moves first owns the category.

I built the product and I'm looking for one licence partner. 50/50 revenue split — I build and operate, you provide the regulatory framework.

Wanted to give [Company] first look before I lock in elsewhere. Can we get 20 minutes this week?

# Notes
- ONLY use this after you've sent the first wave and have at least one conversation going
- If nobody's responded, this is a bluff and it'll backfire
- Manufactured urgency works but needs a kernel of truth
